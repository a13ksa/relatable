### Single Post
On feed we are limited to just relate to post, but when we extend post, we can comment and read comments of others.
Comments contain our opinion, and before commenting we need to relate so comment can be positive or negative.
That is the reason behind Relate and Can't Relate, commenting about your opinion on someone else's thoughts. <br />
